She wrote to Ni Nyampinga seeking advice for what to do when she gets her first period. \r\n\r\nAlice, so many girls have written to me wondering the exact same thing. To all of my young nieces out there who are anxiously awaiting their first periods, let me take the time to answer any questions you might have and offer you a bit of guidance.  I\u2019m thrilled to be back with Issue 13 of Ni Nyampinga!\r\n\r\n**SEVEN THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR PERIOD** \r\n\r\n**1.\tINFORMATION IS EVERYTHING!**\r\n\r\nKnowing the facts about getting your period is so important. If you have any questions about going through puberty ask your mum, an aunt or an older friend\u2014someone you feel comfortable with who\u2019s been through these changes herself! She\u2019ll be able to teach you about different sanitary products like pads and dedicated pieces of clothing that help you stay clean so you can keep going to school and enjoying your everyday life.\r\n\r\n**2.\tNO SHAME**\r\n\r\nWhen you get your first period, don\u2019t panic! Want to know why? It\u2019s totally normal. Every girl gets a menstrual period, so don\u2019t feel frustrated or embarrassed. On average, girls start menstruating when they\u2019re about 12 years old, but it\u2019s possible to get your first period earlier than that and even as late as age 18.  \r\n\r\n**3.\tBE PREPARED**\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good idea to carry a sanitary pad with you in case your period starts unexpectedly. And don\u2019t worry\u2014you\u2019ll know when you\u2019re starting your period before it ends up on your dress. You\u2019ll notice some light spotting or darker discharge on your underwear when you go to the bathroom. At this point, you can put on the pad or other sanitary product that you\u2019ve been carrying with you. Remember to ask a woman you trust how to put on a pad before your first period starts so you\u2019ll know what to do. If you need some extra tips, check out Issue 10 of Ni Nyampinga. \r\n\r\n**4.\tKNOW WHAT\u2019S COMING\u2026**\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re on your period, you might not feel your best. It is possible you might get backaches, stomach cramps, headaches or feel tired. You might also break out in pimples on your face, back, or chest. This is all normal. Most of the time, these symptoms will go away after your period ends, but they might last longer as a result of your body\u2019s hormones. If you\u2019re experiencing any prolonged pain or discomfort, tell a woman you trust or go to see your doctor. \r\n\r\n**5.\tKEEP CLEAN**\r\n\r\nMake sure you keep your body nice and clean when you\u2019re on your period. You don\u2019t need to sit in the bath all day, but try to bathe or shower once in the morning and once in the evening. Your period flow tends to vary\u2014some days will be heavier than others, so you can adjust how often you change your pad. If you\u2019re experiencing a heavy flow, you\u2019ll want to change it several times a day to avoid any leaks or unpleasant smells. Many schools have girls\u2019 restrooms where you can go to change your pad\u2014just don\u2019t forget to throw used ones away! If you\u2019re using reusable pads, wash them in cold water with soap and then dry them in the sun or iron them. When you\u2019re in the bath cleaning your body\u2019s intimate areas, use water without soap.\r\n\r\n**6.\tDON\u2019T BE FOOLED BY BAD INFO**\r\n\r\nYou may have heard that having sex can cure symptoms of your period or even improve your physical appearance. That\u2019s simply not true! Having sex has no effect on what you look like and won\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d you of your period or anything that comes along with it. If you decide to engage in sexual intercourse, always use protection to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.\r\n\r\n**7.\tBE AWARE OF RISKS**\r\n\r\nHaving your period means you\u2019re able to get pregnant. Sexually transmitted diseases like HIV can be passed on at any time, whether or not you\u2019re menstruating and even before you get your first period. So if you decide to have sex, make sure you always use protection to avoid unplanned pregnancies and STDs. Do you know all the different ways you can protect yourself? Which one sounds the best to you? If you\u2019re not familiar with the different forms of protection you can use, ask a woman you trust or go to a youth center or doctor\u2019s office so you\u2019re well aware of how to keep your future bright and beautiful. \r\n",
