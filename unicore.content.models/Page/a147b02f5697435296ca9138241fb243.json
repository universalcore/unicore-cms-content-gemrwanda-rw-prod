  "content": "It used to be that in Rwanda, only boys were allowed to make money. Now, girls can earn and keep their own money, but there are mixed feelings about this across the country. Ni Nyampinga spoke to two women who work and earn their own money and put them in touch with each other to chat about how Rwandan society views girls who are financially independent. One of the women lives in the city while the other lives in a rural area.\r\n\r\nSandrine Isheja Butera is 27 years old and comes from a family of three kids and a single mother. Sandrine stayed in school, got good grades, went to university, and now works as a radio host and MC.\r\n\r\nSandrine says that being financially independent means you get to have a lot of fun. \u201cI paid the tuition to get my master\u2019s degree myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve bought land and now I\u2019m planning to buy a car.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe connected Sandrine with Solange, a 24-year-old who comes from a family of 12 children and who, like Sandrine, was raised by a single mother. Solange worked hard to save enough money to start her own business. She now owns a restaurant called Umucyo in the Kirambo Business Center in the Gakenke district. \r\n\r\nSolange is proud of having her own money. She said, \u201cI don\u2019t rely on my mother for any financial help. Instead, I support her. Now I\u2019m saving for the future.\u201d\r\n\r\nSolange asked Sandrine if having her own money ever caused problems with others. Sandrine replied, \u201cEven in cities, when you\u2019re a girl with a lot of money, some of your friends think you\u2019re stuck up. Other people say that having a job means you no longer care about having friends because you don\u2019t go to visit them. But I work really hard to always make time for friends and family.\u201d  \r\n\r\nSolange talked to Sandrine about what it\u2019s like being a girl with her own money in the Kirambo Business Center. \u201cPeople are intimidated by the fact that I have my own money!\u201d she related. \u201cI used to have a boyfriend, but he broke up with me. He said that it was too easy for me to get close with other guys when I\u2019m travelling for business. He also said that I wouldn\u2019t be able to respect him if I had a lot of money on my own!\u201d\r\n\r\nSandrine asked Solange if she felt that owning a business was worth it if it meant that some people would think of her in a negative light. Solange replied that she has developed her own techniques to handle people\u2019s criticism. She told us \u201cI just set goals for myself. I\u2019m optimistic and show respect to everybody.\u201d \r\n\r\nSandrine and Solange urge other girls to work hard and make their own money. They both say that it\u2019s the only way for girls to get everything they need. As the saying goes, \u201cak\u2019imuhana kaza imvura ihise,\u201d or, if you wait for others to do things for you, they\u2019ll do it when you no longer need it!\r\n",
